# EtherStellar: A Gas-Fee-Free Future for Decentralized Transactions

**Abstract**

EtherStellar (STELLAR) introduces a novel gas-fee-less token built on the Arbitrum network, aiming to revolutionize decentralized transactions by eliminating the barrier of high gas fees. This white paper explores the EtherStellar ecosystem, its tokenomics, innovative features, and roadmap for development.

**1. Introduction**

Blockchain technology has revolutionized finance by enabling peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. However, high gas fees on popular blockchains like Ethereum have hindered mainstream adoption.  EtherStellar addresses this challenge by offering a gas-fee-less token on the Arbitrum network, a Layer 2 scaling solution known for its efficiency and security.

**2.  The EtherStellar Ecosystem**

**2.1 EtherStellar Token (STELLAR):**
